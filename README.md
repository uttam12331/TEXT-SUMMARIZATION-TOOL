This repository contains a minimal yet powerful Python-based application that performs automatic text summarization using a local language model (LLM) via Ollama and the LangChain framework. It leverages the Phi-3 language model, one of the most efficient and compact open-source models, to summarize long pieces of text into concise, human-readable summaries. This solution is lightweight, easy to run locally, and ideal for research, education, or integration into larger AI workflows.

üß† Project Description
As the volume of digital content continues to grow, the ability to quickly extract meaningful information from long documents becomes increasingly important. Whether you're dealing with:

Research papers

News articles

Documentation

Reports

Summarization helps reduce cognitive overload by presenting essential information in a much shorter form.

üß© Key Features
This project demonstrates a local-first AI solution that achieves this goal by combining:

Phi-3 language model (via Ollama)

LangChain for prompt construction and orchestration

It is a perfect starting point for developers, students, and researchers who want to:

‚úÖ Build custom summarization workflows
‚úÖ Learn how to run LLMs locally with minimal setup
‚úÖ Avoid cloud dependency and maintain data privacy

‚öôÔ∏è Application Flow
A long input text is passed to the summarization function.

A summarization prompt is generated using LangChain‚Äôs PromptTemplate.

The prompt is sent to the Phi-3 model running locally via Ollama.

The model returns a concise summary.

The output can be printed, stored, or integrated into another system.

üîí Privacy and Efficiency
This tool avoids using external cloud APIs, making it:

Privacy-friendly (no data sent outside your machine)

Cost-effective (no API subscription required)

Offline-capable, ideal for local servers, research labs, or edge devices
